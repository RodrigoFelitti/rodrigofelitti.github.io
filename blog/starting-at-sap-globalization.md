# Starting My Journey at SAP Globalization

Two months ago, I started my journey as a Fullstack Software Development Intern at SAP Globalization in São Leopoldo. This has been an incredible experience, and I wanted to share my thoughts on transitioning from academic projects to enterprise-level software development.

## From Student to Professional Developer

The jump from university projects to working on mission-critical enterprise systems used globally was both exciting and challenging. At SAP, I'm not just learning to code - I'm learning to build software that scales, performs, and maintains high standards of quality and security.

## What I'm Working On

My daily work involves:

- **Cloud-Native Microservices** - Building and maintaining services using Java and Spring Boot
- **Frontend Development** - Working with JavaScript, TypeScript, and SAP UI5
- **DevOps Practices** - Implementing CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and GitHub Actions
- **Quality Assurance** - Writing comprehensive tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end)
- **Global Collaboration** - Working with distributed teams across different time zones

## The Learning Curve

### Technical Skills

The transition to enterprise development introduced me to:

1. **Microservices Architecture** - Understanding how to design, build, and deploy distributed systems
2. **Test-Driven Development** - Writing tests first, then implementing features
3. **Design Patterns** - Applying proven solutions to common problems
4. **Containerization** - Using Docker and Kubernetes for deployment
5. **Observability** - Monitoring and troubleshooting production systems

### Soft Skills

Beyond code, I've learned:

- **Agile Methodologies** - Participating in Scrum ceremonies and sprint planning
- **Code Reviews** - Both giving and receiving constructive feedback
- **Documentation** - Writing clear, maintainable documentation
- **Communication** - Working effectively across languages and cultures

## Challenges I've Faced

### 1. Scale and Complexity

University projects are typically small and self-contained. At SAP, I'm working on systems with millions of users, where every decision about performance, security, and scalability matters.

### 2. Legacy Code

Not everything is greenfield development. Learning to understand, maintain, and improve existing codebases has been a valuable skill.

### 3. Enterprise Standards

There are standards and processes for everything - version control, code quality, security, deployment. While it seemed overwhelming at first, I now understand these practices ensure quality and reliability.

## What Surprised Me

**The supportive culture** - Everyone is willing to help and share knowledge. Senior developers take time to mentor interns and junior developers.

**The technology stack** - Working with cutting-edge technologies while maintaining legacy systems. It's a perfect learning environment.

**The global impact** - Knowing that the code I write affects payroll and HR systems used by companies worldwide is incredibly motivating.

## My Setup and Tools

Here's what I use daily:

- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA for Java, VS Code for JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins for automated builds and deployments
- **Monitoring**: Dynatrace for application performance
- **Collaboration**: Jira for project management, Teams for communication
- **Database**: SAP HANA, DBeaver for database management

## Tips for Future Interns

If you're starting an internship in software development, here's my advice:

1. **Ask Questions** - Don't be afraid to ask. Everyone was new once.
2. **Take Notes** - Document everything. You'll thank yourself later.
3. **Read Code** - Spend time understanding existing codebases.
4. **Write Tests** - They save time and prevent bugs in production.
5. **Learn Git Well** - Version control is essential for collaboration.
6. **Embrace Feedback** - Code reviews are learning opportunities.
7. **Stay Curious** - The tech field evolves rapidly. Keep learning.

## What's Next

I'm excited to continue growing at SAP. My goals for the coming months:

- Deepen my understanding of microservices architecture
- Contribute to more complex features
- Learn more about cloud infrastructure (AWS, SAP BTP)
- Improve my code quality and testing practices
- Share knowledge through documentation and this blog

## From Robotics to Enterprise Software

It's interesting how my journey from building rescue robots in high school (3rd place at OBR state level!) to enterprise software development connects. Both require:

- Problem-solving skills
- Team collaboration
- Attention to detail
- Continuous learning
- Resilience when things don't work

The difference is scale - but the fundamentals remain the same.

## Conclusion

Starting at SAP has been one of the best decisions of my career. I'm learning from experienced developers, working on meaningful projects, and building skills that will serve me throughout my career.

If you're considering an internship in software development, my advice is simple: go for it. The learning curve is steep, but the growth is exponential.
